# Side-Projects

Hello! I'm a 4th-year student at the University of Georgia studying Management Information Systems and Data Science. I'm excited to apply my classroom learnings into tangible projects, whether it be in a corporate work setting or taking on new side projects, where I will be converting raw data into actionable decisions and insights. The number of projects on my profile will grow as I continue to practice and learn more about the field.
