# Side-Projects

Hello! I'm a 4th-year student at the University of Georgia (UGA) studying Management Information Systems and Data Science. I'm excited to apply my classroom learnings into tangible projects, whether it be in a corporate work setting or taking on new side projects, where I will be converting raw data into actionable decisions and insights. The number of projects on my profile will grow as I continue to practice and learn more about the field of Data Science.

<h2>Project Descriptions</h2>

<h3>Slickdeals Sentiment Analysis (Late Nov. 2019)<h3>
<p>
  Who doesn’t like a good deal? I certainly do, so I’ve decided to build and implement a model that deciphers whether a product is worth buying on <a href="http://slickdeals.net" target="_blank">slickdeals.net</a>. For those not familiar, Slickdeals is a website that serves as a platform for people to share products that they find on the internet that are priced well below their manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP). These items can be made up of many types of product categories, including groceries, video games, electronics, clothing, home appliances, and much more.
</p>

<p>
  For each of the products, there is a very active, well-informed community that posts their opinions about the products and talks about whether the product is worth buying. The goal of this project is to apply sentiment analysis to create an effective machine learning model and generate understanding about an effective way to combine English lexicon and data science to generate a modern day solution for online shopping.

<h3>NBMBAA Job Postings Web Scrape, Text Analysis, and Visualization (Late Sep. 2019)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://nbmbaa.org/conference/" target="_blank">National Black MBA Association (NBMBAA) Conference</a> is an annual career fair where top-tier companies attend to recruit a diverse group of students from universities all around the country.</p>

<p>A group of UGA MBA students attend each year, and this project is designed to help these students get a convenient view of all the <a href="https://careersuccess.nbmbaa.org/jobs/?keywords=&event_id=4070&sort=" target="_blank">job postings</a> on the website as well as analyze the text on the postings to get insight on the verbage being used by companies in their job descriptions. The goal here is so that students can tailor their resumes based on these keywords to match job descriptions and bypass a potential <a href="https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/what-is-an-ats-resume" target="_blank">ATS screening</a>.

<p>Additional documentation for more details on the project and my methodology is included in the project folder.</p>

<h3>MBA 2020 Student Profiles (Early Sep. 2019)</h3>
<p>While working at the MBA Career Management Center at my school, a director was wondering if there was a way to extract the names, number of years of work experience, and company for each student in the profile book (named "Terry_2020_FTMBA_ProfileBook_v4.pdf" in the MBA 2020 Student Profiles folder) without having to go through each student and manually inputting his/her information into an Excel spreadsheet, since this would be banal and time-consuming.</p>

<p>After cleaning, maniuplating, and reshaping the MBA 2020 student profile data, I created a program that effectively organized the raw text and vizualized the necessary information. Included in the folder are the PDF file and student roster list that I was given, the .txt file that I worked with throughout, the program I wrote, and the final output in .csv format. </p>
