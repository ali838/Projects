# Side-Projects

Hello! I'm a 4th-year student at the University of Georgia studying Management Information Systems and Data Science. I'm excited to apply my classroom learnings into tangible projects, whether it be in a corporate work setting or taking on new side projects, where I will be converting raw data into actionable decisions and insights. The number of projects on my profile will grow as I continue to practice and learn more about the field.

<h3>MBA Student Profile Project</h3>
While I was working at the MBA Career Management Center at my school, a director was wondering if there was a way to extract the names, number of years of work experience, and company for each student in the profile book (named "Terry_2020_FTMBA_ProfileBook_v4.pdf" in the MBA 2020 Student Profiles folder) without having to go through each student and manually inputting his/her information into an Excel spreadsheet, since this would be banal and time-consuming.

I told him I could help him out, and after a day of cleaning, maniuplating, and reshaping the MBA 2020 student profile data, I created a solution that effectively organized the raw text and vizualized the necessary information. He was extremely grateful for the work I put in and solution that I built, and I was pleased that I was able to provide business value by taking data in its most raw form and gathering insight from it.
