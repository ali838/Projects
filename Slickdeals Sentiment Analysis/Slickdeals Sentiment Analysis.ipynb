      "fyi best buy is offering the same deal for those that dont like amazon just add the 2 cam set and then the extra camera to your cart 0\n",
      "i ended up getting this deal hopefully it work better than the amazon cloud cam i currently have thanks op 1\n",
      "is this recommended over the 2c model seem to be the same price 1\n",
      "i think it depends on what you are using it for the 2c camera have half the battery life and doe not come with a antitheft alarm feature if you use then 2c mostly indoors where people arent tempted to steal then maybe 2c is worth it the 2 model ha an improved sensor but i havent compared the difference at night 0\n",
      "anyone who owns this could you tell me if there is a cool down period between alert 1\n",
      "there are three camera working mode that you can select per camera 1\n",
      "could i able to connect this base station wireless or wired connection is required for this to work  0\n",
      "wired to setup then you can unplug and go wireless 1\n",
      "i have both the 2 and 2c model and no they dont really have a cool down mode ive seen them record a minute apart i prefer the 2 model over the 2c it a pretty good camera system for what it is and from my research into this type of battery camera system between ring arlo blink reolink and couple others this is a better system depends on what you are looking for battery operated and is supposed to last 365 day lot longer than others but of course it depends on how many alert per day and recording time good day and night vision it a 1080p camera so someone spotted in le than 25ft or so you can get a decent image local storage of video military encryption good mobile app for complete control over the camera and video you easily download a video to your phone or do a screen print from your phone ha an antitheaf siren built into the camera so if someone try to steal it had human detection and activity zone to limit false alarm no contract or monitoring fee cloud storage optional for a fee but i wont use that other goody 1\n",
      "i would be putting them outdoors is the battery removeable or do i have to unmount the whole camera to charge if battery is easily removeable i guess charging it once a year v multiple time a year isnt a big deal just wondering if having night time color is such a big deal 0\n",
      "hi shmegal what vendor are calling night time color camera are basically camera with superior sensor that allows you to typically leave them in normal light mode when it get dark le sensitive sensor you had no other option but to use ir led illumination to see in low light many of these so called color night vision camera actually still retain ir led so you can actually have an even better and sharper ir illuminated black and white image so yes having a camera capable of remaining in color around the clock is significant and even if you opt to have it go into bw ir mode you will get superior image 1\n",
      "thank for the reply and what about theft it look like stealing these is a easy a turning the camera counterclockwise until it unmounts are there more secure mount 1\n",
      "hi shmegal if youre worried about theft then the best option is to go with a quality wired system and install them with 12 long screw into a stud solid wood or similar normally the screw included are a bit too short for a good deep screwed in setup imho so i locate a stud and drive a 3 screw or 2 in i prefer ip poe myself 1\n",
      "i appreciate your feedback i guess i will opt for this thanks 1\n",
      "for anyone getting these hoping to mount and record parallel to the mounted wall i recommend the arlo mount a they have a lot more flexibility in term of rotation 1\n",
      "no battery is not really removable but it a rechargeable battery since eufy is an anker company i imagine they are using anker rechargeable battery ive been using anker battery pack charger for year they are top of the line in my opin these do not do color vision at night unless there is enough light i have motion light in front and back so i turn off ir mode to force the camera to do color when my light come on much better picture in color now if it completely dark and you use ir mode it would show a bw picture so if someone is relatively close you can get a decent image but not a good a more light and color image so i recommend people put up motion light and turn ir mode off for a better pic at least thats how i use them 0\n",
      "nope have a look at youtube review it better than arlo 1\n",
      "2c also ha shorter range 0\n",
      "according to the review the camera are connected to the homebase only range is about 8 meter if there a wall in between and not directly to your home wifi network so how do you setup 3 camera with 1 homebase if you want to use them for the frontdoor and backyard 0\n",
      "thanks op just ordered this 1\n",
      "just because battery last 365days doesnt make it 350 worth please research better deal and skip so the manufacture will lower their unreasonable price there are 35 cam with way more benefit and le limitation wyze is on the right track with consumer in mind therefor i invest in their cam yes battery is easy but is it worth overpaying 1\n",
      "wyze is a very good value but for a turnkey setup this is pretty good how do you set up a battery pack for wyze wyze only record at 720p or other lower resolution and upscales to 1080p even before learning this ive always felt the audio and video is a little underwhelming for those who dont want to or dont know how setting up a bay station is an additional step do you have issue with scrolling timestamp v watermark timestamp it is painful to accurately scroll to other event how do i go from a triggered event to the rolling sd card storage dont get me wrong i own and like wyze and this is quite expensive though not arlo level but there solid value here for a 3camera ip 65 newest system from eufy i also have an like their doorbell 1\n",
      "im looking for local noninternet connected solution for live viewing from same place doe anyone ha any recommendation i have several cloud based solution if i watch them live shitfinity sends bandwidth exceed message and charge for extra internet bandwidth 1\n",
      "are they a lot better than arlo we got the original and theyve been a dismal failure one loses connection after a couple day oddly enough it the one close to the base the others more or le work but are unreliable looking for a decent replacement 0\n",
      "i never had any connection issue ive been using them since nov i had many issue with nest camera nest doorbell and nest hub max where they were unable to reconnect after loosing wifi signal with nest i had to restart wifi router many time i dont have arlo but my friend ha them and i compared the quality eufy is far better 0\n",
      "nice thank you itd be nice to have a wireless camera that actually work wirelessly so disappointed in arlo 1\n",
      "no connection issue either the notification work well 95 of the time during the day and i would say 7580 at night nigihtime need some additional lighting in order to pick up thing better the floodlight however work 100 much better than nest and ring would highly recommend 1\n",

      "hi matt im looking at security cam a i received a ring security floodlight cam with pro chime from costco a a christmas gift but i dont want to be tied to cloud and amazon monthly charge also this requires running powerbox for the flood ideally battery powered wifi cam are easiest but then i too am leaning to poe cam a it easier to run cat56 and i would think it would eliminate wifi delay and also permit 247 video streaming v shorter battery powered video clip im curious why the wd deal with 4 poe cam 2tb purple drive with base for only 199 isnt more popular johnc 0\n",
      "doe this system do sound 1\n",
      "hi johnc if youre on a tight budget i think that wd deal for 200 for what look to be a complete 4 camera and nvr 2hdd ip poe kit is a really good deal sam88 typically only post good kit camera nvrs so imho worth it do look for note here or on ipcamtalk about wiring it up to avoid water dripping into the connector 1\n",

      "i personally have used both the 2c had better motion detection maybe just the placement on the housing v the lense both are pretty equal in the night vision dept in pure darkness really not that spectacular on a porch with a dim porch light on both work great the led flood on the 2c is pretty useless the range of the 2 from homebase wa the biggest difference other than battery that i personally experienced the 2c with the homebase in the exact same spot could not get a connection to a 2c camera at my shed probably 100 out back the 2 ha zero issue keeping a solid feedconnection 0\n",
